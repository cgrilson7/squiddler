![Zach's explanation of the challenge](challenge.png)

## Solution:

I've taken a simulation-based approach to estimating the number of survivors. My code can be found in `squid_game.R` and in the `README.Rmd` file that produced what you're reading now.

**(Spoiler Alert)** 

In this episode, some of the players are fortunate enough to have a former glass factory worker posit his guesses before they do, taking his leaps based on the optical and acoustic differences between tempered and normal glass.

In these simulations, I've assumed the glassmaker's judgments to be infallible - he, and thus and all players behind him, will survive with 100% probability. However, his placement in the order of players is random.

Below are the results of my simulation with, and without, the help of this player.

```{r run-sim, echo = FALSE}
# results <- dplyr::bind_rows({
#   # run the sim 500K times without player 017
#   500000 %>% purrr::rerun(sim(
#     n_players = 16,
#     n_tiles = 18,
#     player_017 = FALSE
#   )) %>% bind_rows()
# },
# {
#   # run the sim 500K times with player 017
#   500000 %>% purrr::rerun(sim(
#     n_players = 16,
#     n_tiles = 18,
#     player_017 = TRUE
#   )) %>% bind_rows()
# })
# 
# save(results, file = 'sim_results.Rdata')
load('sim_results.Rdata')
```

### Probabilities that *x* players survive:

```{r plot-1, echo = FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height = 6, fig.alt = "Overlapping frequency distributions of the number of survivors in this simulation, where one group has the advantage of having the glassmaker with them. This shows that on average, 7 players will survive without him, and around 10 will survive with his help."}
